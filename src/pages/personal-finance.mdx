## Brokerages

### Stake <Tnt>[[link](https://hellostake.com/au)]</Tnt>

$3 brokerage fee (or 0.01% for larger trades). CHESS sponsored.

Stake has a referral system. Ask around in [`#personal-finance`](https://discord.com/channels/1083238120645992458/1095879685948317706) for a referral code!

_**[2024-01-15] simshadows says:** My personal choice for my own investing! I just buy ETFs on Stake. **Lowest fees on the market for a CHESS sponsored brokerage** as far as I've seen. In the end, fees is the main thing you can control to maximize your investment returns. However, **Stake lacks automated investing features** (something Pearler seems to do well), and the **fees are lower elsewhere if you go for a non-CHESS brokerage and don't mind some restrictions**. I personally don't mind the lack of automation, and I prefer the added confidence of a CHESS sponsored broker in case anything goes wrong._

### Pearler <Tnt>[[link](https://pearler.com/)]</Tnt>

$5.50 flat brokerage fee. CHESS sponsored.

_**[2024-01-15] simshadows says:** I've never used Pearler, but it seems like a great option. **The fees are really low while still being CHESS sponsored** (close enough to Stake's $3 fee), and [**Pearler lets you automate your investing!**](https://pearler.com/explore/ask/help/4771917-how-does-autoinvest-work) I expect that this means you'll just be automatically debited every month or so, and that money is automatically invested into your asset split? Hard for me to be sure if I haven't used it. Please look into this before you deciding on using Pearler! Full automation is a common piece of advice I hear since it reduces the risk of making a mistake with managing your portfolio, otherwise you might succumb to the temptation to time the market - and I can speak from experience when I say you should never time the market. Invest regularly no matter what!_

### Vanguard Personal Investor <Tnt>[[link](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/personal-investor)]</Tnt>

No fees for buying Vanguard funds. **$9 flat brokerage fee and 0.1% p.a. account-keeping fee for non-Vanguard assets.** NOT CHESS sponsored.

_**[2024-01-15] simshadows says:** I've never used VPI, but it also seems like a **great option as long as you're ONLY interested in Vanguard funds**. I think that Vanguard ETFs are great so you can't go wrong with them. Also [**seems to feature automation**](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/auto-invest) similar to Pearler. If you want non-Vanguard shares, the fees are too high, especially when it lacks CHESS sponsorship. Lack of CHESS sponsorship may hurt confidence in investing with VPI, but I feel like maybe the difference in risk might be realistically zero? I'm not sure. Do your own research for this one._

### CommSec <Tnt>[[link](https://www.commsec.com.au/)]</Tnt>

Brokerage fees start at $5 for trades <Latex code="\le \$1000" />, but fees go up substantially for larger trades. CHESS sponsored.

_**[2024-01-14] RJ says:** Nice layout and mobile app._

_**[2024-01-15] simshadows says:** The **fees are really, really high**. However, it's also owned by Australia's largest bank (CommBank), and it may also be Australia's largest brokerage firm. I'm tempted to discourage people from using CommSec, but I think it's actually not a bad choice. Investing can be scary, especially if you're not familiar with the financial institutions you're dealing with. **CommSec and its parent CommBank are very strong names that people may feel more confident investing their life savings with.** To me, investing with CommSec's high fees will always be better than never investing at all._

### SelfWealth <Tnt>[[link](https://www.selfwealth.com.au/)]</Tnt>

$9.50 flat brokerage fee. CHESS sponsored.

SelfWealth has a referral system. Ask around in [`#personal-finance`](https://discord.com/channels/1083238120645992458/1095879685948317706) for a referral code!

_**[2024-01-15] simshadows says:** Fees are high with SelfWealth compared to Stake and Pearler, but still better than something like CommSec. I can't recommend them at this time since they don't offer any advantages over other brokerages, but they're also not a bad choice if you like them._
