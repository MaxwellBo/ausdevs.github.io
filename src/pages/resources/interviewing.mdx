*This page focuses on **intern/grad/entry-level software engineering** for now. Hopefully, we can compile further resources for more senior roles.*

Want mock interviews? Post a *looking-for-mocks* thread in <Channel name="interviews-and-mocks" /> on Discord!


## Behavioural Interviews

Recommended resources:

- [**Tech Interview Handbook: Behavioral interview preparation**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/) (Free)


## System Design Interviews

[**Tech Interview Handbook: System design interview guide for Software Engineers**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/system-design/) is a great meta-resource.

Although Tech Interview Handbook covers plenty, here are some resources popular in the AusDevs community:

- [**GitHub: donnemartin / system-design-primer**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) (Free)
- *System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide* by Alex Xu (Non-Free Book)


## Technical Interviews

*[**Data Structures and Algorithms Resources**](/resources/data-structures-and-algorithms/) covers the computer science theory relevant for technical interviewing.*

Recommended resources:

- [**Tech Interview Handbook: Coding interview preparation**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) (Free)
