import Channel from "@components/Channel";


*This page focuses on **intern/grad/entry-level software engineering** for now. Hopefully, we can compile further resources for more senior roles.*

Want mock interviews? Post a *looking-for-mocks* thread in <Channel name="interviews-and-mocks" /> on Discord!

## System Design Interviews

[**Tech Interview Handbook: System design interview guide for Software Engineers**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/system-design/) is a great meta-resource.

Although Tech Interview Handbook covers plenty, here are some resources popular in the AusDevs community:

- \*[**GitHub: donnemartin / system-design-primer**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) (Free)
- \***System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide** and [**ByteByteGo**](https://bytebytego.com/) by Alex Xu (Non-Free Book)
- \*[**GitHub Gist: vasanthk / System Design.md**](https://gist.github.com/vasanthk/485d1c25737e8e72759f) (Free)
- **The Grad/Intern Playbook: Part 3 - Acing the Interviews** by sai
    - [**System Design Interviews**](https://www.saikumarmk.com/guide-to-tech-3/#system-design-interviews) (Free)

## Technical Interviews

*[**Data Structures and Algorithms Resources**](/resources/data-structures-and-algorithms/) covers the computer science theory relevant for technical interviewing.*

Recommended resources:

- [**Tech Interview Handbook: Coding interview preparation**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) (Free)


## More Resources

Other resources that aren't covered by the sections above but may still be worth looking into:

- We've linked relevant bits and pieces to sai's *[**The Grad/Intern Playbook**](https://www.saikumarmk.com/guide-to-tech-faq/)* already, but it can be worth checking it out in full!
